Hello I Am on Windows 10 and need some help seting up a build so I Can properly Debug. When I go to the readme.md It dose not show the proper 
Blob/ Files.It shows only the out dated files. I can not see all of the code and when I read the readme.md file It Drirects me to the Wrong infromation for building.
My Devices I have to test and debug are
Windows 10(with vm capabilities) xbox 1 and android devices.
Thank You
